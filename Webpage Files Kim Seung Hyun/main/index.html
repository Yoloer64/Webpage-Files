              <h5>Top 5 Games of 2022</h5>
            </div>
            <p>2022 was the breeding ground of hundreds if not thousands of new and exciting titles.
                Unlike 2020 or 2021 where game companies showed us the true bottom of the barrel executive decisions
                of unfinished and not very enjoyable games, this year, we have a lot of fun games to play!
            </p>
            <p> Here are the top 5 games of 2022.</p>
            <div class="header">
              <h4>Number 1: Elden Ring</h4>
            </div>
            <img src="assets/elden ring logo.jpg" class="center" 
            width="100%" 
            height="auto"/>
            <p> Elden ring is an open world game in which you explore a medieval-fantasy 
                like setting with your character and battle numerous enemies. Following
                the Dark Souls formula, Elden Ring is extremely punishing to newer players
                and doesn't come with a difficulty setting. </p>
            <img src="assets/elden ring.jpg" class="center" 
                width="100%" 
                height="auto"/>
               <p>Despite its punishing boss battles and lack of modern game UI that many companies use such as a 
                navbar, minimap, radial item wheel, and more, the game is a breath of fresh air in the extremely
                oversaturated open world genre where games lead players to specific points of interests without 
                really allowing them to explore the world on their own. Though many newer players have complained
                about the lack of markers and navigation tools, the lack of such distractions allows players to 
                traverse the well crafted world of Elden ring on their own and stumble into unique situations,
                accomplishing a true sense of adventure that not many other games can replicate.</p>

                <div class="header">
                  <h4>Number 2: Lego Starwars: The Skywalker Saga</h4>
                </div>
                <img src="assets/skywalker saga logo.jpg" class="center" 
                width="100%" 
                height="auto"/>
                <p>While many people may not have seen this coming, LEGO's new game has garnered a significant amount
                    of interest as it triggers a lot of people's nostalgia for older LEGO games. Set in the StarWars 
                    universe, the player mainly follows the journey of Anakin Skywalker and his appearances in numerous
                    movies. Though the game isn't fundamentally different from older games, it does extremely well in 
                    recreating a lot of iconic scenes from the movies. 
                 </p>
                <img src="assets/skywalker saga.jpg" class="center" 
                width="100%" 
                height="auto"/>
                <p> Despite its lackluster appearance, the simple controls and unique LEGO themed jokes pans out really well
                    for a lot of players. As it is a game meant for a more family-friendly audience, a lot of the violence and 
                    gore is replaced with simple bricks breaking and death really isn't a true death. However, this only adds to
                    the charm of the game and perhaps surpasses the movie's rendition of Anakin's journey.
                </p>
                
                <div class="header">
                  <h4>Number 3: Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe Edition</h4>
                </div>
                <img src="assets/stanley parable ultra deluxe logo.png" class="center" 
                width="100%" 
                height="auto"/>
                <p>Now, the original Stanley Parable was puzzling, yet impressive. The game is based around a simple plot of a man
                    named Stanley escaping his job as the Narrator "narrates" stanley's journey. However, during the journey, the 
                    player is presented with a choice; follow the Narrator's script, or go off the beaten path. Both options are viable
                    as they lead to a myriad of different paths, outcomes, and dialogue from the narrator. However, unlike the base game,
                    Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe adds more than double the content to the base game, with more places to explore, more endings
                    to find, more jokes to hear from the narrator, and most importantly, more buckets to adventure with. 

                    <img src="assets/stanley parable ultra deluxe.jpg" class="center" 
                width="100%" 
                height="auto"/>
                <p>Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe is a once in a decade type of game where a branching path of actions so numerous actually comes 
                  together really well and works towards a single narrative. A narrative experience like no other, and one simply can't describe 
                  the feeling of playing it with a single word. And of course, how could we not talk about the narrator? The narrator's soothing 
                  voice guides the player throughout the game, and both narrates Stanley's actions while striking a one-sided conversation with
                  him. This combination really sells a unique dynamic that helps sell the game's narrative further, and makes the faceless, bodyless
                  narrator a real lovable character.
                </p>
                <div class="header">
                  <h4>Number 4: It takes two</h4>
                </div>
                    <img src="assets/it takes two logo.png" class="center" 
                width="100%" 
                height="auto"/>
                It takes two is a 2 player CO-OP game that has an extremely interesting premise. Though split-screen CO-OP is pretty rare 
                to see, especially with advanced networking allowing players all around the world to play with each other with minimal lag,
                it is still refreshing to see developers continue the tradition. It takes two is a mainly narrative-driven game, similar to
                "A Way Out" and "A Tale of Two Brothers" where players control two characters within a setting with similar, if not the same
                camera to look from. The story follows a couple who planned on getting a divorce being turned into dolls as per the wish of 
                their child who doesn't want to see them fight or divorce. In order to change back, the couple must complete a series of puzzles
                that require the cooperation of both of them.
                <img src="assets/it takes two.png" class="center" 
                width="100%" 
                height="auto"/>
                While the story may be a bit simplistic, the character building, different puzzles, and absolutely stunning visuals make up for it.
                Each of the characters start out as dislikeable, but as the players continue the journey, the characters become lovable and even 
                relatable by the end. The unique and challenging 2-player puzzles also make players use their heads a lot, and also require cooperation,
                bring not only the characters, but real people closer together as well. And how could I forget the absolutely cartoony and cute visuals?
                The cartoony yet realistic visuals really sell the atmosphere of both the characters and the background while the color palatte makes the 
                game stand out and engaging.

                  <h4>Number 5: Surviving Mars</h4>
                </div>
                <img src="assets/surviving mars logo.jpg" class="center" 
                width="100%" 
                height="auto"/>
                <p>While Mars may seem like an extrmeley attractive prospect to live in, is it truly? Surviving Mars is a Real-Time Strategy survival
                  game where the player creates a livable environment for the colonists to survive in while precariously balancing their needs and wants.
                  The end goal is to create a self-sufficient habitable area where the colonists could live as they please, or at least try to survive until
                  the next re-supply ship arrives. You first decide where to settle the city on a randomly-generated map with randomly generated terrain and 
                  resources, and build out your civilizations from there.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/surviving mars.jpg" class="center" 
                width="100%" 
                height="auto"/>
                <p>While the game may be a real-time strategy survival game, it also encorporates a lot of civilization building aspects as well. Not only do 
                  you have to balance consumable resources such as food, water, and air, you also have to manage other resources such as electricity, communications,
                  and money in order to purchase things from Earth. Not only that, but you also have to balance each colonist's needs, lest you want a strike or something
                  worse to happen that may jeopardize the colonist's survival. There are also random events that players will also have to deal with, some good, some bad,
                  some catastrophic.
